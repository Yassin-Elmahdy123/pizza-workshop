    <p>Mashed Potatoes is a very tasty and creamy meal for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</p>
    <p>You can make mashed potatoes through different ways.</p>
    <p>But I will talk about my favourite way to make it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">First you need to gather these ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 big-sized potatoes or 3 medium-sized potatoes.</li>
        <li>1 big spoon full of butter.</li>
        <li>3 tbsp of salt, black pepper, cumin, and hot pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Second you need to do these steps in order:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Put your potatoes in a pot containing boiling water.</li>
        <li>while waiting for the potatoes to be cooked, put your spices and butter in the serving plate.</li>
        <li>You will know that the potatoes are cooked when you are able to enter a fork in the potatoes easily.</li>
        <li>drain the potatoes from the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Put the potatoes in the serving plate.</li>
        <li>Mash the potatoes while mixing them to spread all the spices and butter evenly.</li>
        <li>Eat with bread and have fun.</li>
    </ol>
